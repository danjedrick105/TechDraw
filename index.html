            of art have been made into a <b>transformed anti-aircraft system</b>
            <b>The first digital drawing software was executed on the first Mac computers</b>
            <b>First digital art exhibition took place in 1968.</b> In the year 1968, 
            the Institute of Contemporary Art welcomed visitors to the Cyber ​Serendipity.
            Digital graphics were shown alongside drawing machines for the robot K-456 by 
            Jean Tinguely and Nam June Paik. <b>You can work as Medical Animator.</b> It may
            surprise you to learn that digital artists play a significant role in the medical
            profession. As a medical animator, you can graphically interpret knowledge and help
