                <h1>DIY STYLUS PEN</h1>
                <p>A homemade stylus pen is a Do-It-Yourself gadget that is made to be used with touchscreen screens. 
                    It usually consists of a conductive medium, such as aluminum foil, that replicates the electric 
                    characteristics of a human finger. The minimum form usually comprises a pen or a pencil as the core, 
                    and aluminum foil wrapped around it for the purpose of conducting electricity. For extra comfort, 
                    a sponge or cotton swab can be applied at the tip to provide a softer and more accurate contact point. 
                    The end result is a working and cost-effective substitute for commercially available styluses!</p>

                <h2>Steps:</h2>
                <h3>1. Prepare the Pen or Pencil:</h3>
                <p>Use an old pen or pencil. If using a pen, remove the ink cartridge to reduce weight.</p>
                <h3>2. Wrap with Aluminum Foil:</h3>
                <p>Wrap foil tightly around the pen, leaving about an inch exposed at the tip.</p>
                <h3>3. Make the Tip:</h3>
                <p>For a softer tip, attach a sponge or cotton swab at the writing end and secure it with foil.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text2">
                <h3>4. Secure with Tape:</h3>
                <p>Use tape to hold the foil firmly in place.</p>
                <h3>5. Test the Stylus:</h3>
                <p>Try using your stylus on a touchscreen; it should work just like a store-bought one!</p>
                <h3>Materials Needed:</h3>
                <p><b>Pen/Pencil, Aluminum foil, Tape, Sponge/Cotton Swab, Scissors</b></p>

            <h1>Body Components</h1>
            <p><img src="Human Body.jfif" alt="Human Body" width="180" height="190">
                Drawing body parts requires subdividing the human form into simple forms and shapes such 
                as circles, ovals, and cylinders to plan the head, torso, arms, legs, and joints. Based on 
                these simplified forms, you enhance the muscles, contours, and finer details without 
                sacrificing proportion and symmetry. The inclusion of movement and gesture adds vitality 
                to the sketch, accentuating the body's natural flow and movement.</p>

                <h1>Human Head</h1>
            <p> Drawing a human head is done by making an oval shape with a top and chin. 
                Vertical and horizontal guidelines split the head into equal halves and eye level. 
                Place facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline with horizontal lines. 
                This technique guarantees symmetry, balance, and proportion in a human face drawing. </p>
              
            </div>
            <div class="text1">
            <h2>Steps: </h2>
            <h3>1. Draw the Basic Shape </h3>
            <p>Start with a light pencil and sketch an oval or an egg-like shape for the head. 
            The narrower end will be the chin, and the wider end will represent the top of the head.</p>

            <h2>2. Add Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Lightly draw a vertical line down the center of the oval to divide the head into two equal halves.
            Draw a horizontal line across the middle to mark the eye level. For a front view, 
            this line divides the oval into approximately two equal parts.</p>              
            </div>
            <div class="text2">
                <h2>3. Mark Facial Features</h2>
            <p><b>Eyes:</b> Divide the horizontal line into five equal sections. The eyes will sit on the second and 
                fourth sections, with one section space between them.</p>
            <p><b>Nose:</b> Draw a horizontal guideline halfway between the eye line and the chin for the base of the nose.</p>
            <p><b>Mouth:</b> Place another guideline about halfway between the nose and the chin for the mouth. Adjust 
            the width of the mouth to align with the center of the eyes.</p>
            <h2>4. Draw the Jawline</h2>
            <p>Define the jawline by adding lines from the sides of the oval down to the chin. Make it smooth and symmetrical.</p>
