                <h1>DIY STYLUS PEN</h1>
                <p>A homemade stylus pen is a Do-It-Yourself gadget that is made to be used with touchscreen screens. 
                    It usually consists of a conductive medium, such as aluminum foil, that replicates the electric 
                    characteristics of a human finger. The minimum form usually comprises a pen or a pencil as the core, 
                    and aluminum foil wrapped around it for the purpose of conducting electricity. For extra comfort, 
                    a sponge or cotton swab can be applied at the tip to provide a softer and more accurate contact point. 
                    The end result is a working and cost-effective substitute for commercially available styluses!</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Steps:</h2>
                <h3>Prepare the Pen or Pencil:</h3>
                <p>Use an old pen or pencil. If using a pen, remove the ink cartridge to reduce weight.</p>
                <h3>Wrap with Aluminum Foil:</h3>
                <p>Wrap foil tightly around the pen, leaving about an inch exposed at the tip.</p>
                <h3>Make the Tip:</h3>
                <p>For a softer tip, attach a sponge or cotton swab at the writing end and secure it with foil.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text2">
                <h3>Secure with Tape:</h3>
                <p>Use tape to hold the foil firmly in place.</p>
                <h3>Test the Stylus:</h3>
                <p>Try using your stylus on a touchscreen; it should work just like a store-bought one!</p>

                <h3>Materials Needed:</h3>
                <p>Pen/Pencil, Aluminum foil, Tape, Sponge/Cotton Swab, Scissors</p>

            <h1>Body Components</h1>
            <p><img src="Human Body.jfif" alt="Human Body" width="180" height="190">
                Drawing body parts requires subdividing the human form into simple forms and shapes such 
                as circles, ovals, and cylinders to plan the head, torso, arms, legs, and joints. Based on 
                these simplified forms, you enhance the muscles, contours, and finer details without 
                sacrificing proportion and symmetry. The inclusion of movement and gesture adds vitality 
                to the sketch, accentuating the body's natural flow and movement.</p>

                <h1>Human Head</h1>
            <p> Drawing a human head is done by making an oval shape with a top and chin. 
                Vertical and horizontal guidelines split the head into equal halves and eye level. 
                Place facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline with horizontal lines. 
                This technique guarantees symmetry, balance, and proportion in a human face drawing. </p>
              
            </div>
            <div class="text1">
            <h2>Steps: </h2>
            <h3>Draw the Basic Shape </h3>
            <p>Start with sketching an oval or an egg-like shape for the head. 
            The narrower end will be the chin, and the wider end will represent the top of the head.</p>

            <h3>Add Guidelines</h3>
            <p>Lightly draw a vertical line down the center of the oval to divide the head into two equal halves.
            Draw a horizontal line across the middle to mark the eye level. For a front view, 
            this line divides the oval into approximately two equal parts.</p>              
            </div>
            <div class="text2">
            <h3>Draw the Jawline</h3>
                <p>Define the jawline by adding lines from the sides of the oval down to the chin. Make it smooth and symmetrical.</p>
            <h3>Mark Facial Features</h3>
            <p><b>Eyes:</b> Divide the horizontal line into five equal sections. The eyes will sit on the second and 
                fourth sections, with one section space between them.</p>
            <p><b>Nose:</b> Draw a horizontal guideline halfway between the eye line and the chin for the base of the nose.</p>
            <p><b>Mouth:</b> Place another guideline about halfway between the nose and the chin for the mouth. Adjust 
            the width of the mouth to align with the center of the eyes.</p>

                <h2> Human Eye</h2>
                <p>Create an almond shape to frame the eye's main structure, 
                    the sclera. Sketch a circle for the iris and a smaller circle for the pupil, 
                    adding intricate details. Circular eyelids and curved eyelashes create realism. 
                    The eyebrow arch can be textured with hair-like strokes. 
                    The upper eyelid often overlaps the iris, while the eyebrow arch is textured with hair-like strokes.</p>
              
            </div>
            <div class="text1">
                <h2> Steps: </h2>
                <h3>Start with the Outline:</h3>
                    <p> Draw an almond or oval shape for the basic outline of the eye. 
                        This will be the boundary of the eye. </p>                   
                <h3>Sketch the Eyelids:</h3>                   
                    <p>Add a curved line above and below the outline to indicate the eyelids. 
                        The upper lid is usually more pronounced.</p>                   
                <h3>Place the Iris and Pupil:</h3>                   
                    <p>Draw a circle inside the almond shape for the iris. 
                        The top and bottom of the iris might be slightly covered by the eyelids.</p>                 
                    <p>Inside the iris, draw a smaller circle for the pupil in the center.</p>                    
            </div>
            <div class="text2">
                <h3>Add Highlights:</h3>                   
                <p>Draw one or two small circles in the iris to represent light reflections. 
                    Leave these areas white when shading.</p>                   
            <h3>Draw the Eyelashes:</h3>                                   
                <p>Add short, curved lines along the top and bottom eyelids for the eyelashes. 
                    Eyelashes on the upper lid are usually longer and thicker.</p>
            <h3>Refine the Eyebrows:</h3>                   
                <p>Sketch an arched line above the eye for the eyebrow 
                    and add small hair-like strokes to give it texture.</p>
            <h3>Add Details and Adjustments:</h3>
                <p>Refine your lines and shading. Check the proportions and symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Human Ear</h2>
                <p>Start with an oval as the overall outline. Add a curved outer edge for the helix, 
                    and within it, sketch the antihelix, tragus, antitragus, and the concha. These inner 
                    details create the folds and depth of the ear. Shade the deeper areas like the concha 
                    and folds for realism, while keeping lighter gradients for smoother curves. Finish 
                    with the earlobe at the bottom and refine with texture and shading.</p>
              
            </div>
            <div class="text1">
            <h2> Steps:</h2>
            <h3>Outline the Basic Shape:</h3>
                <p>Start with a rough oval or egg shape tilted slightly to match the natural ear's angle. 
                    This will form the overall boundary.</p>                
            <h3>Add the Inner Structure:</h3>                
                <p>Draw a smaller oval or curve inside the larger shape to represent the ear's inner boundary (the concha).</p>               
                <p>Add a C-shaped curve along the outer edge‚Äîthis is the helix (the outer rim of the ear).</p>               
                <p>Below and inside the helix, draw another smaller curve to represent the antihelix (the inner rim).</p>              
            </div>

            <div class="text2">
            <h3>Define the Earlobe:</h3>               
                <p>At the bottom of the oval, sketch a rounded or slightly curved shape for the earlobe. 
                    It can vary in size and thickness depending on the style or reference.</p>
            <h3>Adjust for Perspective:</h3>
                <p>If the ear is viewed from an angle, adjust the proportions and perspective to reflect its position on the head.</p>

            <h2> Human Nose</h2>
                <p>Start with a vertical guideline and basic shapes like a triangle or trapezoid to outline 
                    the structure. Add rounded shapes for the nose tip and nostrils. Use shading to define 
                    the sides of the bridge, beneath the tip, and around the nostrils for depth. Highlight 
                    the tip and bridge to create dimension. Focus on soft lines and subtle blending for a natural look.
                    A well-drawn nose balances proportions, curves, and shading, making it look natural and harmonious 
                    with the face. Let me know if you'd like help drawing it from a specific angle or in a particular style!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text1">
            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <h3>Start with Basic Shapes:</h3>
                <p>Draw a vertical guideline to divide the nose symmetrically.</p>
                <p>Add a triangle or trapezoid shape for the nose bridge and nostrils.</p>
            <h3>Outline the Structure:</h3>
                <p>At the bottom of the triangle, sketch two circles for the nostrils.</p>
                <p>Add a smaller circle or oval between them for the nose tip.</p>
            <h3>Refine the Shape:</h3>
                <p>Smooth out the bridge into a curved line. Blend the tip and nostrils into the overall shape.</p>
                <p>Define the nostril openings as curved lines inside the circles.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text2">   
            <h2>Tips:</h2>  
            <h3>Add Depth and Details:</h3>  
                <p>Lightly shade the sides of the bridge to create depth.</p>
                <p>Add shadows around the nostrils and under the tip.</p> 
            <h3>Define Highlights and Shadows:</h3>
                <p>Leave lighter areas on the nose tip and bridge for highlights.</p>
                <p>Use darker shading along the edges and under the nose to create dimension.</p>
            <h3>Refine and Adjust:</h3>
                <p>Erase unnecessary guidelines and refine the lines.</p>
                <p>Blend your shading for a smooth, realistic look.</p>

            <h2> Human Lips</h2>
                <p>Begin with a horizontal guideline. Sketch the "Cupid's bow"(based on the 2 circle) for the upper 
                    lip and a smooth curve for the lower lip(based on a 1 big circle). Add soft edges to connect them 
                    at the corners. Use shading to add depth‚Äîdarker near the edges and lighter 
                    in the center for highlights. Finish with subtle vertical lines for texture.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text1">
            <h3>Start with a Guideline:</h3>
                <p>Draw a horizontal line to mark the center of the lips. This is where the upper and lower lips meet.
                Optional: Draw also a vertical line to mark the center of the lips</p>
                <p>Draw a 3 circle align with the line. The middle circle must be bigger than the side one</p>
            <h3>Outline the Shape:</h3>
                <p>Above the horizontal line, sketch the bow shape of the upper lip. 
                Start with two curved lines meeting in the middle to create the "Cupid's bow."
                Below the line, draw a smooth, rounded curve for the bottom lip. 
                Make it fuller and more pronounced than the upper lip.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="text2">
            <h3>Define the Outer Edges:</h3>
                <p>Connect the edges of the upper and lower lips, keeping the shape natural and proportional.</p>
            <h3>Highlight Texture:</h3>
            <p>Add small, vertical lines across the lips to mimic their natural texture. Keep the lines subtle and soft. </p>    
            <h3>Tip:</h3>    
                <p>Leave small areas unshaded or use an eraser to create highlights, usually on the upper lip's bow 
                    and the center of the lower lip.</p>
